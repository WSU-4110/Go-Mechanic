          <h2>Why Do I Need it?</h2>
          <p>Unless you drive an electric vehicle, your vehicle is likely powered via an internal combustion engine, requiring oil. Over time, these fast moving parts break down the oil and diminish its ability to absorb heat or lubricate the engine. This is why your vehicle needs to have its oil changed regularly. If you continue to use old oil, your engine has a great chance of overheating or just seizing altogether. New oil from an oil change lets the engine run smoother, cleaner and more safely.</p>
          <h2>How Often Do I Need an Oil Change?</h2>
          <p>It depends on many factors, including what kind of vehicle you drive, how often do you drive, and whether you drive the vehicle hard. Car manufacturers have created standardized mile-based intervals. Every manufacturer creates unique schedules, but changing your oil every 3,000 to 5,000 miles will never hurt. </p>
